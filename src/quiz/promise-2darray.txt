Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

The code execution order based on the logged messages is as follows:

1. "Sum called ... " is logged immediately when sum2DArray is called, indicating the promise's execution starts.
2. For a valid array, "returning from sum" is logged next, showing the function continues execution after setting up the promise.
3. The asynchronous setTimeout callback is placed in the event queue, even with a delay of 0ms, allowing synchronous code to run first.
4. For an invalid input, "rejecting ... " is logged before "returning from sum" since rejection occurs immediately within the same execution context.
5. "resolving ... " is logged once the setTimeout executes, indicating the sum calculation is complete and the promise is about to resolve.
6. "The sum is: " or "Error: " is logged based on whether the promise is resolved with the sum or rejected due to an invalid input, showcasing the .then() or .catch() execution.
